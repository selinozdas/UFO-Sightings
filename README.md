#UFO Sightings Data Exploration
"If we're the most intelligent things in the universe… well, that's just depressing." - Rekha Sharma

In this project I am to explore the UFO Sightings Dataset by National UFO Reporting Center. Here are some of the questions I'll try to find answers to:
What areas of the countries are most likely to have UFO sightings? Do the sightings share common descriptions on the same locations?
Are there any trends in UFO sightings over time?
